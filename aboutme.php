  <p><u>About me:</u> - I have been doing web development for about 20 years and started in late 90's when the internet took off.
    <br>In my previous life was a Chemical Engineer but made the change to Web development during the DotCom boom. Have never
    regretted it.<br>
    I have been dabbling in a lot of Microsoft technologies inclding Classic ASP, Asp.net, SharePoint and SQL server.

    <br><br>
     <u>Why I am I taking this course ?</u>
     <br>This is my third course @Harvard Online Extension school and hope to complete 2 more to get the Certificate in Web Technologies
     by end of 2017.<br />
    These classes have given me tremendous amount of knowledge.
    <br>I hope to become a full stack developer and broaden my skillsets by taking this class. Though I am not using php for work I will definitely be using
    it to create content for non profit sites.
  </p>

  <p><u>Current Situation</u>
    I am recovering from an accident related surgery and will be starting
     a new position in a health care IT firm in Philly as SharePoint analyst soon.
     <i>Very excited about this.</i>
     <br />Was very fortunate to have excellent care at the hospital and at home.
     The whole theme of my projects will be healing applying conventional and non conventional methodologies.<br >
